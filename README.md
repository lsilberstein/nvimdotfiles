# nvim dotfiles

This repository tracks my dotfiles for my personal nvim Setup. I plan to eventually outsource init.lua into separate files to navigate more easily and make the code easier to understand, but as of now I'm still trying to learn about all about nvim in general.

## Installation <a name = 'installation'/>

Install Neovim through your preferred package-manager. Since I am on a Mac I was using homebrew:

	brew install neovim

Clone this repository into 

	~/.config/nvim

Starting nvim afterwards should do the rest.

### Additional Installations <a name = 'additionalinstallations'/>

Since the default Mac Terminal lacks quite some features I use iTerm2 with Nerdfonts (in particular 'Hasklug' Nerd Font). 
For Window management I use a lightly configured tmux-Installation with 'oh-my-tmux'.

## Tutorials <a name = 'tutorials'>

I mainly used [this](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/build-your-first-lua-config-for-neovim/) Tutorial and plan to build on top of it.
